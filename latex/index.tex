This is the main page of the documentation for my C++ Shopping Store Application.

\mbox{\hyperlink{class_home_Home}{Home}} is the main entry point into the application. ~\newline
 \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8cpp_ae66f6b31b5ad750f1fe042a706a4e3d4}{main}} performs some setup (creating nescessary objects) and then calls \mbox{\hyperlink{class_home_af37e6f3e876567384e5bfe8a425cd7cd}{Home\+::main()}} to execute the program.

\mbox{\hyperlink{class_generics_Generics}{Generics}} provides a handful of generic helper functions useful throughout the project.
